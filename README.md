## Implementation
1. To map your environment, execute the steps in the catkin_ws directory


```$ catkin_make```

```$ source devel/setup.bash```

```$ roslaunch agv agv_odom_ekf_spawn.launch```

```$ roslaunch agv agv_device_init.launch```

```$ roslaunch agv agv_hector.launch```

```$ rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py ```



2. To navigate the robot in your environment, execute the steps in the catkin_ws directory

```$ catkin_make```

```$ source devel/setup.bash```

```$ roslaunch agv agv_odom_ekf_spawn.launch```

```$ roslaunch agv agv_device_init.launch```

```$ roslaunch agv agv_agv_move_base_amcl_turtlebot.launch```
